                <p>
                    Cyberstryke is a 3D third-person arena hack and slash game that takes place within a virtual retro sci-fi world, 
                    where the player is a robot that can use many different weapons against enemy AIs that also have the same moves 
                    and weapons just like the player. Player has to go through five rounds with each round increases the AIs difficulty 
                    and aggressiveness.

            <p><b>Platform:</b> Windows PC</p>
            <p><b>Engine:</b> Unreal Engine 4 (Blueprints, C++)</p>
            <p><b>What I’ve worked on:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Combo System</b>  for the player to have chain of attacks and two button combos.</li>
                    <li><b>Animation Transfer</b> and Implementation from animators into the UE4’s character system for basic movement 
                        (walking, strafing, blocking and impact), weapon attacking and switching, and tieing with the combo system. 
                        Prototype animations uses Mixamo animations as a placeholder with the default UE4 model as the mesh. 
                        However, some animation doesn’t have root bone for it to work properly in the project, 
                        I used Blender 3D to implement the root bone and clean the bones for the prototype demo to work properly.</li>
                    <li><b>User Interface</b> for the Main Menu, the Gameplay HUD and Lock on Target.</li>
                    <li><b>VFX shaders and particles</b> on hit sparks and character on impact.</li>
