                <h2>UMW Interactive Experience (2023)</h2>
                <P>
                    UMW Interactive Experience is a showcase experience for UMW Holding's industrial and marine equipment.
                    The experience is shown on two screens. The right view presented on a projector screen, shows the 3D overview of areas and equipments in action. 
                    The left view presented on a touch screen allow users to explore through the equipment catalog in detail; each with the equipments's name, description 
                    and their manufacturer's logo. 
                </P>
                <p></p><b>Role:</b> Unity Programmer</p>
                <p><b>For:</b> UMW under Weyrdworks</p>
                <p><b>Platform:</b> PC</p>
                <p><b>Engine:</b> Unity 3D (C#)</p>

            <p><b>What Iâ€™ve worked on:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>UI Programming</b> for the whole touch screen experience. I program and animate the sequence following the designer's classification.</li>
                <li><b>Material transition</b> for the equipment highlights and see-through environment. The equipment will change colour from orange to their true respective 
                colours based on what machine the user inspect in the touch screen. I also programmed the see-through material when the camera is near the environment, which lowers 
                the environment's alpha and allowing the user to see the equipment. </li>
                <li><b>3D artist</b> on fixing the equipment models that require to optimise the experience such as low poly count or visible holes.</li>
            </ul>
